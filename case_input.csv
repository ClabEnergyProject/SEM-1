"This file is documentation for the input data format for the case definition file, used as input for the Simple Energy Model v 1.0",,,,,
,,,,,
This is an example of the file format. This part of the file is for comments only.,,,,,
,,,,,
Completely blank rows will be ignored.,,,,,
Items with unknown keywords will be ignored.,,,,,
Keyword names are case insensitive.,,,,,
,,,,,
"To reduce errors, if one keyword exists relevant to a technology, all keywords for that technology must be defined (i.e., if you have capacity_cost_wind, you must have a dispatch_cost_wind).",,,,,
,,,,,
"All energy-related (i.e., capacity) costs are in terms of $/hr per kW capacity, except for variable generators (wind and solar) it is cost per hour of deployment at the level of the associated capacity file.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Note that costs of technologies with associated capacity files (e.g., wind solar) are assumed to be of the form where fixed costs the cost of hour of acheiveing the potential generation in the associated capacity file (i.e., there is no further normalization within the code).",,,,,
,,,,,
"All power-related (i.e., generation) costs  are in terms of $/kWh dipatched",,,,,
Variable cost of energy storage (dispatch_cost_storage) is in units of $/hr per kWh stored.,,,,,
,,,,,
"If the fixed cost for a technology is entered as a negative value, then that technology is assumed not to participate in the optimization.",,,,,
,,,,,
"It is assumed that the time series files will be a csv file with at least 5 columns:  year, month, day, hour, data. Subsequent columns will be ignored.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Hours are in the range of 1 to 24, where hour 1 is between midnight and 1 AM. Hour 24 is between 11 PM and midnight.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Required parameter data include: verbose, root_path, quick_output.",,,,,
,,,,,
Required case data includes case_name.,,,,,
,,,,,
"Allowable case keywords may appear either in the ""global data"" section or the ""case data"" section.",,,,,
,,,,,
Keywords that appear in the global section apply to all cases.,,,,,
"So, for example, if all cases are to be run for the same time period, the start and stop time information could be put in the global section.",,,,,
,,,,,
"Required GLOBAL keywords are: VERBOSE, SWITCH_POSTPROCESS",,,,,
,,,,,
Required CASE keywords are: CASE_NAME,,,,,
