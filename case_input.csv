"This file is documentation for the input data format for the case definition file, used as input for the Simple Energy Model v 1.0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is an example of the file format. This part of the file is for comments only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Completely blank rows will be ignored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Items with unknown keywords will be ignored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keyword names are case insensitive.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To reduce errors, if one keyword exists relevant to a technology, all keywords for that technology must be defined (i.e., if you have fix_cost_wind, you must have a var_cost_wind).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All energy-related (i.e., capacity) costs are in terms of $/hr per kW capacity, except for variable generators (wind and solar) it is cost per hour of deployment at the level of the associated capacity file.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note that costs of technologies with associated capacity files (e.g., wind solar) are assumed to be of the form where fixed costs the cost of hour of acheiveing the potential generation in the associated capacity file (i.e., there is no further normalization within the code).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All power-related (i.e., generation) costs  are in terms of $/kWh dipatched",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Variable cost of energy storage (var_cost_storage) is in units of $/hr per kWh stored.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If the fixed cost for a technology is entered as a negative value, then that technology is assumed not to participate in the optimization.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note that costs of technologies with associated capacity files (e.g., wind solar) are assumed to be of the form where fixed costs the cost of hour of acheiveing the potential generation in the associated capacity file (i.e., there is no further normalization within the code).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is assumed that the time series files will be a csv file with 5 columns:  year, month, day, hour",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Hours are in the range of 1 to 24, where hour 1 is between midnight and 1 AM. Hour 24 is between 11 PM and midnight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"The example case below does a 3-year simulation, first with wind and storage and then with solar and storage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
BEGIN_PARAM_DATA,"""BEGIN_PARAM_DATA"" is a keyword that must be in the first column of the file. This section defines various flags (if any) that will be true for all of the simulations. Param keywords must be in the first column. Param value must be in the second column. Other columns are treated as comments.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
